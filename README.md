 In 'sliding_03' for left_camera after frame 121, for right_camera after frame 195 - no events (with default settings)

 In 'checkerboard_flat_lr.bag', on prophesee camera events are unsorted and occasinally have negative timestamps, while
 on samsung there are gaps. Need to investigate. See https://github.com/better-flow/evimo/tree/evimo2/evimo/bag_sanity
